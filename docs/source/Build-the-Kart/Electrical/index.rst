The go-kart Power and Control system are designed as a modular
system, consisting of several subsystems that are responsible
for different tasks. There are six major subsystems: Power
Distribution (PD), Main Control (MC), User Interface (UI),
Throttle-by-Wire (TBW), Brake-by-Wire (BBW), and Steerby-Wire (SBW). The “x-by-wire” system design approach has
been gaining popularity in the automotive industry which is to
replace conventional mechanical and hydraulic control systems
with electronic signals. The elimination of traditional
mechanical components could increase control stability, increase design flexibility, reduce cost, and improve efficiency. In our go-kart drive-by-wire design, all subsystems
except the PD use an STM32 Nucleo development board on
a standalone PCB as the electronic control unit (ECU). Like
modern vehicle design, communication is achieved using the
controller area network (CAN) to allow efficient information
exchange between nodes. These modular control systems
are integrated with the original go-kart chassis in a nonintrusive manner and are easy to understand, build, and modify.
