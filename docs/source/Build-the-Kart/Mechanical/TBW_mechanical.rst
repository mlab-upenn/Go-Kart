Throttle-by-Wire Mechanical assembly
====================================

Motor
--------
We chose the ME1816 BLDC, but are still trying to tune the settings here
TopKart suggested brushed motor worked fine, but with a low max speed, lower efficiency, and inability to go in reverse


Motor mount
--------
Same as before! No need for further elaboration. Maybe slide this a bit, if you need the chain to get tighter or looser, or if you need to avoid interference with the right battery box.


Chain
--------
Same as before! No need for elaboration. You can also remove individual links from the chain using a specific tool



Speed sensor
--------
TODO Learn more about this. Mounting CAD coming soon!


Tires
--------

Mention that the wheels should be pumped to 18-24 psi


TODO Insert images, which I just took at like 12am
