.. warning::

   Especially when connected in series, these batteries create very high voltages. When
   connected accidentally in certain configurations (such as through a human body, via your arms),
   you can close the loop and short the circuit, withstanding 48V. It is highly recommended that
   you exercise caution, namely by (1) wearing electrically-insulating gloves, (2) touching only 
   one part at a time, and (3) avoiding wire clutter and/or damage.

The go-kart is powered by six (nominally) 12V LiPo batteries. Specifically, 4 batteries are arranged in series to supply 48V powering all the motors, and 2 batteries are connected in series powering everything else; for more on this, see the Electrical section (TODO Insert Link) We chose to use LiPo batteries since they are lighter, and have higher capacity than lead acid batteries as suggested by TopKart.

LEFT SIDE

Make sure to mention order of battery installation and removal


Mention importance of routing wires through battery handles and
through aluminum profile slots, to avoid clutter and EMI interference

Mention washers under screws

Mention switch for supplemental components

Include overhead diagram of voltage across batteries, from 0 to 48V



RIGHT SIDE

Mention assymetry of left vs right bottom plate

Mention vertical t-slot, for wire routing

Mention avoiding conflict with narrow end of chain
