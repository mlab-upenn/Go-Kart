==================================
Rear Shelf Assembly
==================================

The rear shelf is critical for housing several of the system's various electrical components, as well as mounting some sensors (namely LiDAR, camera, and GNSS) high enough to obtain useful data. Each of these components is discussed elsewhere in this documentation (link here), so this section will discuss solely the mechanical processes for mounting everything securely. The full CAD assembly can be found at this link (find this!!) The step-by-step process is as follows:

Step 1: Cut six t-slots to length, approximately 210mm (2x) nad 146mm (4x). Then, mount them vertically as shown below in the CAD diagram. Note that the left and right components are symmetrical, so I'll discuss only the right side for simplicity.

Step 1a: For the backmost t-slot, this connects in two ways, as shown in the images below. First, an M5 screw goes through a circular hole in the back; note that the mating nut inside the t-slot pocket will be hard to position due to its downward gravity, so you might benefit from holding it upright with some small tool, such as an Allan wrench inserted in the larger hole underneath. Second, a long M6 screw goes through the circular hole on the side, attaching to nuts on the opposite side; note that we used some large black rubber washers (one is circled in red) to ensure a tight fit here.

Step 1b: For the middle and frontmost t-slot, these connect in two ways as well, as shown in the images below. First, it rests on a hexagonal nut (and washer) which was already there to hold the bronze axle bearing mount in place. Make sure there is contact with the nut or washer, otherwise the t-slot might eventually become lose and slip in either direction. Second, a long M5 screw in attached from the other side of this bearing mount.

Step 2: Cut two t-slots to ~420mm, and attach each horizontally to the three t-slots from Step 1, using the four connectors circled in yellow below. Use a leveling tool to make sure this is perfectly horizontal, to ensure stability of the components that will subsequently rest on top; you might need to insert some washers in between the Step 1 and Step 2 t-slots, to adjust the height and ensure it is level.

Step 3: Cut two t-slots to 656mm, and attach as shown by some combination of t-slot connectors

Step 4: Cut four t-slots to 140mm, and attach them vertically in all four corners, two of which are shown below.

Step 5: Cut two t-slots to 696mm, and attach horizontally on top of the t-slots from Step 4.

Step 6: Cuts four t-slots to 140mm, and cut two t-slots to 284mm. These will compose the left and right GNSS tower. Assemble them as shown in the image below

Step 7: Cut two t-slots to 610mm, and attach them vertically as shown below. Note that they connect flat on top of the t-slots from Step 3, as well as adjacent to the t-slots from Step 5; this second connection provided extra stability. Note that a height of 610mm worked for us given our requirements from the LiDAR and camera on top, but different applications might call for different heights.

Step 8: Cut two t-slots to 304mm and 160mm (respectively), and assemble them horizontally in the T-shaped configuration shown below, on top of the tall t-slots from Step 7.

Step 9 (optional): Attach the Ouster LiDAR (link coming shortly) 

TODO Insert image RSD_CAD_9

Step 9a: Cut and assemble two more t-slots, to the lengths and orientations laid out in the CAD. You may wish to insert the M5 nuts for Step 9b as you do this, since they will be harder to insert later. 

Step 9b: Using M5 screw, nuts, and washers, screw in the "Ouster Mount" part (custom machined, link coming shortly) in the 12 locations as indicated below



Step 9c: Screw in the Ouster LiDAR itself, in the four holes around the corners of the Ouster Mount
