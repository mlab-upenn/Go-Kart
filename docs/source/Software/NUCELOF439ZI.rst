Introduction
===============

The STM32 Nucleo-144 boards based on the MB1137 reference board (NUCLEO-F207ZG,

NUCLEO-F303ZE, NUCLEO-F412ZG, NUCLEO-F413ZH, NUCLEO-F429ZI, NUCLEO-
F439ZI, NUCLEO-F446ZE, NUCLEO-F722ZE, NUCLEO-F746ZG, NUCLEO-F756ZG,

NUCLEO-F767ZI and NUCLEO-H743ZI) provide an affordable and flexible way for users to
try out new concepts and build prototypes with STM32 microcontrollers, choosing from the
various combinations of performance, power consumption and features. The ST Zio
connector, which extends the ARDUINO® Uno V3 connectivity, and the ST morpho headers
make it easy to expand the functionality of the Nucleo open development platform with a
wide choice of specialized shields. The STM32 Nucleo-144 boards do not require any
separate probe as they integrate the ST-LINK/V2-1 debugger/programmer. The STM32
Nucleo-144 boards come with the comprehensive free software libraries and examples
available with the STM32Cube MCU Package, as well as a direct access to the Arm® Mbed
EnabledTM on-line resources at http://mbed.org.
