Software Requirements
=======================


1. SolidWorks
-----------------------

SolidWorks is a 3D CAD software that is used to design the mechanical parts of the robot. Most of the Go-Kart systems were developed on SolidWorks. Throughout the documentation you will find several CAD files which can be opened with SolidWorks and modified according to your requirements. 

Download the latest version of SolidWorks from the [SolidWorks website](https://www.solidworks.com/sw/support/downloads.htm). You will need to create an account to download the software.


2. VSCode or editor of your choice
-----------------------

VSCode is a free and open source code editor. It is used to write the code, design this website and basically everything related to development of the Go-Kart. You can use any other editor of your choice.

Download the latest version of VSCode from the [VSCode website](https://code.visualstudio.com/). You do not need to create an account to download the software.


3. STM32CubeIDE
-----------------------

STM32CubeIDE is a free and open source IDE for STM32 microcontrollers. It is used to write and flash the code for the microcontroller. You can view the timer constants and change individual registers of the microcontroller when needed. Throughout the documentation you will find multiple links of preconfigured projects for each subsystem. 

Download the latest version of STM32CubeIDE from the [STMicroelectronics website](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html). You will need to create an account to download the software.

4. VESC tool
-----------------------

VESC is the electronic speed controller that we will be using for the Go-Kart's motors. VESC means Vedder Electric Speed Controller or sometimes called a Variable Electric Speed Controller. It is an open source project and is used in many electric vehicles. You would need to download the VESC tool to setup the VESC hardware and configure the individual motor settings based on instructions in respective subsystems.

Download the latest version of VESC tool from the [VESC website](https://vesc-project.com/vesc_tool). You will need to create an account to download the software.

5. Altium Designer
-----------------------

Altium Designer is a PCB design software that is used to design the PCBs of the Go-Kart. Throughout the documentation you will find several PCB files which can be opened with Altium Designer and modified according to your requirements. If you are just following to replicate the Go-Kart, you do not need to modify the PCBs.

Download the latest version of Altium Designer from the [Altium website](https://www.altium.com/altium-designer/free-trial?TrackingId=PM21&_bk=altium%20designer&_bt=624432473263&_bm=e&_bn=g&_bg=147362585168&gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw8symBhAqEiwAaTA__PmU0ptv8Dj0SRdIjaB3vZBarYjGbGMozxQVuBmgonsHDKZm-V81NRoCpqgQAvD_BwE). You will need to create an account to download the software.

6. 3D printer software like MakerBot
-----------------------

MakerBot is used to slice the 3D models and generate the G-code for the 3D printer. You can use any other software of your choice. You will need to print a lot of mounts, structures in order to complete the Go-Kart. This software is very important.

Download the latest version of MakerBot from the [MakerBot website](https://www.makerbot.com/3d-printers/apps/makerbot-print/). You will need to create an account to download the software.
