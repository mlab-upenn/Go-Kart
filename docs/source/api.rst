SENSOR SYSTEM
===============

The sensor system enables research and development in perception, sensor fusion and localization for autonomous racing. Through its position at the beginning of the pipeline for autonomous vehicles, perception plays an essential role and directly influences the performance of all subsequent systems. To enable safe and predictable behavior for different use cases, the go-kart platform offers multiple capabilities to detect and track objects, lanes, and markers in its environment and determines its current position reliably. This section introduces some of the sensing capabilities in the go-kart and their accompanying algorithms

Single-Modality Object Detection
YOLO offers object detection, segmentation, and classifi- cation in one algorithm. Additional benefits include a good generalization, fewer false positives for backgrounds, and the potential of real-time processing. To run object detection, we deploy multiple versions on the go-kart, including Darknet YOLOv3 and YOLOv8.
