Bill of Materials
=================

Here you can find detailed information about the components used in the project. The entire BOM is organized in a table, where each component is described by its name, quantity, price and link to the supplier. We have also included some images to give a visual perspective of the components.

.. note::

    Regarding the motor. If you choose to skip the manual testing part, do not get the Engine kit. Instead, get the BLDC and it's connection componenets as mentioned in the Master BOM
